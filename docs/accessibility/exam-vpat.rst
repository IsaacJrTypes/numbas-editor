Numbas runtime Accessibility Conformance Report, WCAG Edition
=============================================================

.. note::

    This accessibility conformance report is intended to help instructors and support colleagues to assess whether Numbas satisfies their accessibility criteria.

    There is a separate :ref:`accessibility statement for students <exam-accessibility-statement>`, describing the accessibility features of Numbas, how to use it with assistive technology and how to adapt it to your needs.

(Based on `VPATÂ® Version 2.4 Rev WCAG <https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat>`__)

Name of Product/Version:

Report Date:

Product Description:
    This report covers the Numbas exam interface used by students, with the default theme.
    It does not cover the Numbas editor or the Numbas LTI tool.
